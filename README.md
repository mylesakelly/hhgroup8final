Welcome to MATH MANIA: A Math Learning Web Application!

OUR TEAM: Jynel Kealon, Khalina Boyce, David Nangui, and Myles Kelly

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The objective of our web application is to help young kids improve their math skills by providing a free online resource for them to practice math equations. We wanted to create a user-friendly and engaging web application that empowers young kids to practice math equations, build their confidence in mathematics, and ultimately improve their math skills in a fun and accessible manner.

This is a web application designed as an educational resource for young kids to practice math equations and learn fun facts about numbers. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and a SQL database.

This math learning web application provides the following features:

Practice math equations: Users can solve various math equations and get instant feedback on their answers.

Fun facts about numbers: Users can explore interesting facts about numbers through interactive quizzes.

Interactive and engaging user interface: The application offers a visually appealing and intuitive interface to enhance the learning experience.

In the future we would love to integrate:

User progress tracking: The application tracks and stores user progress, allowing them to see their improvement over time.
